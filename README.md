# HeriusEngineBase

This repository provides a foundational 2D game engine in Python, using Pygame CE. The structure is modular and designed for developing top-down games, such as shooters, action RPGs, and turn-based RPGs.

Features:

    Scene Management: Control and transitions between different game environments.
    Physics and Collision System: Includes basic physics and collision detection between entities.
    Scene Editor: Standalone software for creating and editing scenes, with import/export support (currently under testing; may not work as expected).

Structure:

    engine: Contains the core engine code.
    games: Game projects that use the engine.
    resources: Assets such as images and sounds.
    tests: Prototypes and tests for development and improvements.

This is a base framework, intended as a starting point for developers interested in expanding or customizing their own engine for 2D game creation.
